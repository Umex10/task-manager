# Task Manager

## Project Description

The **Task Manager Project** is a complete application that includes both a backend and a frontend. The application allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks. 

**This was my first Spring Boot project!**

In this project, I learned a lot, such as working with packages in Spring Boot, the importance of `@Beans`, and how to work effectively with Spring Boot. I understood that structure and organization are crucial for a successful project.

I also learned what Docker is and how to use it.

**Motivation:** This is just the beginning – now it's going to take off with fullstack development!

This project includes:
- A **Spring Boot** backend for business logic and database integration. 
- A **React/TypeScript** frontend for the user interface. 
- Docker integration for easy deployment. 
- Backend and PostgreSQL database deployed on **Railway**.
- Frontend deployed on **Vercel**.
