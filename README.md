# Task Manager

## What is it

The **Task Manager** is a complete app that includes both a backend and a frontend. The application allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks. 

**This was my first S-Boot usage!**

I learned a lot, such as working with packages in S-Boot, the definition of `@Beans`, and how to work effectively with S-Boot. I understood that structure and organization are crucial for a successful java app.

I also learned what Docker is and how to use it.

**Motivation:** This is just the beginning – now it's going to take off with fullstack development!

This app includes:
- A **S-Boot** backend for business logic and database integration. 
- A **React** frontend for the user interface. 
- Docker integration for easy deployment. 
- Backend and P-SQL database deployed on **Railway**.
- Frontend deployed on **Vercel**.
